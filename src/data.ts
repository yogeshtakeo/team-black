    blog: "Are you familiar with React's Context API? It's a powerful feature that allows you to manage global state in your React applications without the need for prop drilling. It's a great tool for passing data down the component tree efficiently and can simplify the process of sharing state between components.The Context API consists of two main components: the Context provider and the Context consumer. The provider component holds the state and provides it to any component that wants to consume it. On the other hand, the consumer component receives the state from the provider and can use it in its own rendering.",

    blog: "React's useReducer hook is another powerful tool for managing state in your applications. It's an alternative to useState and provides a way to manage more complex state logic by using a reducer function. It's especially useful when dealing with state that involves multiple actions and transitions.To start using useReducer, you first need to define your reducer function. The reducer function takes in the current state and an action as parameters and returns a new state based on the action.",
